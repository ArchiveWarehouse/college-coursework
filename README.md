# üí´ About Me:
I'm currently working on some project about what I spent studying through self-study.<br><br>I would appreciate some advice on what I should study next and any errors I made when writing the code.<br><br> And teach me how to use github also. <br><br>

# ‚ùå What I can't do: 
I still cannot figure out how to make my site responsive for phone screens, and other aspects.<br><br>
But I'm willing to learn more about it.<br><br>
